## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Josue, I'm currently studying computer science at UNT interested in building full-stack applications. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a mobile application for semi-truck drivers that will help them easily find repair mechanics. And also building a logistics platform that connects construction contractors with independent dump truck drivers.
